What is a Time Series??‚è≤üìà¬∂
Time-series is series of obeservations that are recorded over a period of time. these observations are dependent of time component which can not be neglected thus we have have to analysis the this data keeping time component in mind.


Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is parhaps one of the most common type of machine learning techniques used in real-world scenarios. `time-sereis forecsting refers to predicting future values from historical data by statical analysis of trends and patterns from certain time-series data.` it falls under unsupervised learning category but called as a self-supervised learning or supervised learning technique. time-series data can be much complex to find patterns out of it, this is because irregular component of time series.
Use-cases and applications:
Forecast product demand
Economic growth and population forecasting
Weather forecasting
Stock price forecasting
Sales/Revenue forecasting
Web-traffic forecasting
Project Idea: A time series analyzes event occurrences over a while. A time series is
analyzed to identify patterns and predict future occurrences based on trends. A time
series is an excellent way to get an idea of seasonal variation and repetitive patterns
and even to identify unexpected events to understand further what could have
caused them. Various models can be used to perform timeseries forecasts. The
model selection depends on multiple factors, including the availability of past data,
the forecast context, the period for which the estimates must be made, and the time
to create and make the model. Some models that can be used for time series
forecasting are moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA (autoregressive
integrated moving average) model. The moving average model is a straightforward
modeling technique that predicts the next occurrence as the mean of all the past
occurrences. Although it seems simple, it is pretty accurate in many places. In the
case of exponential smoothing, the mean is calculated by giving less weightage to
occurrences that are further away from the present. More recent occurrences have
more value in estimating the mean than older events. The ARIMA model is a slightly
more complex model. It is a form of regression analysis that monitors the strength
of one dependent variable based on other changing variables. Check out the source
code to determine which forecasting method to use when and how to apply it with
time series forecasting examples.
